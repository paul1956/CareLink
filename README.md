## Download Latest Release from
https://GitHub.com/paul1956/CareLink/releases/

# Description

This application is designed to show all the available pump data in a visual version that mimics the one on iPhone and in tables that can be exported to Microsoft Excel or the Clipboard.

![Same display](https://GitHub.com/paul1956/CareLink/blob/master/Screenshot%202022-10-08%20203350.png?raw=true)

Some data is filtered out by default because I could not see any use for it. You can turn off filters from Options Menu. but performance will suffer.

- If you get the error below

> "System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: 'Configuration system failed to initialize'"
> will need to edit CareLink\src\CareLink\bin\Debug\net7.0-windows\CareLink.dll.config and remove the following lines
```
